# hedr

## Welcome to hedr - head rewritten in Rust.

### heder is designed to be fast, simple, and secure

## Usage:
```
hedr <yourfile> <options>
```
### Like head - hedr will output the top 10 lines of your file(s) by default. Some options to consider are: 
`-n #` where `#` selects the number of lines from line 0-`#` in `<yourfile>`

`-c #` where `#` selects the number of characters from char 0-`#` in `<yourfile>`
